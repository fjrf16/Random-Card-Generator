## DESCRIPTION

The project consist in a card that is randomly generated by a few buttons, every button has it own function and the functionality of the three are independent to each other. The functions of the buttons can be visualized in the next points:

1. The first button is a button that generates a complete random card, between the whole of the set of cards.

2. The second button is a button where you can generate a random card which suit is not like the previous suit, that means that you can't repeat a suit in two consecutives cards.

3. The third button is a button where you can generate every time you click on the button a different and randomly card, that not fit with another card of the whole set of cards, until we get to the end of the set, then it shows the message that the set is over and reset the set of cards.
